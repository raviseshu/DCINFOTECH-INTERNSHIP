Week 1: 


Data Collection and Preprocessing
Project: Collect a dataset from an online source (e.g.,
Kaggle) and preprocess it using basic NLP techniques.
Document the preprocessing steps.



EXPLANATION
First week of my project focused on processing the medal tally data for the upcoming Paris Olympics using Spring Boot!
Key Accomplishments:

Implemented REST API: Developed a MedalTallyController to handle requests and return processed CSV data.
CSV Data Processing: Created a MedalTallyService to read and parse the medal tally CSV file, utilizing Apache Commons CSV for efficient data handling.
NLP Integration: I started integrating NLP techniques, including tokenization, and meaningfully analyzing the data.
Next Steps:

Enhance the NLP capabilities to extract insights from the medal tally data.
Implement additional features based on the analysis results.
I'm looking forward to diving deeper into this project and sharing more updates soon!
